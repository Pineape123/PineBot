# What is Pinebot?
Pinebot is a mod bot for your Discord server needs! It was mostly created for the [Stock Market Bot support server](discord.gg/K3tUKAV) to replace Dyno and make a in-house solution that we can alter to our needs. It's still in development but features are being refined and added constantly. It has basically all of the features that the major bots have but we are adding more. It's written in Py and uses dpy, we are currently using json files as a form of db.
